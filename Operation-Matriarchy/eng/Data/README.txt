Unofficial Music, Sound and Re-Localization Patch
for OPERATION MATRIARCHY 
-------------------------------------------------
Patch date: 08-21-2007
-------------------------------------------------


1. Intro
--------
Operation Matriarchy (2005) is a fun first-person-shooter that was developed by MADia and published in
several countries by BUKA Entertainment. Unfortunately, the game appears to have been rush-released
in an unfinished state. Unbelievably, it has NO MUSIC whatsoever in-game (the only track being the
catchy theme that plays on the main menu). Also, the in-game sounds are incomplete, used incorrectly
and vary wildly in volume. Some of the weapons are silent, the creatures make the occasional odd
squeak, yet the player's ears are brutalised by high-pitched metallic grating sounds which are meant
to be 'environmental audio.'
It's stunning how much a soundtrack can do for a game, and how much it can suffer without one.
Operation Matriarchy is really an interesting FPS, with a lot of variety, some crazy enemies, fun
weapons and plenty of visual splendor. But it was almost unplayable in its initial state. That's why
we decided to make this patch.


2. Patch Features
-----------------
* Complete in-game soundtrack - 22 new pieces of music!

* Re-balanced and new sound FX - Volumes have been corrected and new sounds added, including weapons.

* Completely re-written in-game script and objective messages

* Newly recorded voices - for cutscenes

* Numerous tweaks/fixes - for various minor issues


3. Requirements
---------------
This patch has been fully tested with the German (English) v. 1.1 of the game - I believe the same 
version was released in most countries. I think this *should* also work with the Russian v. 1.1 
of the game, but I haven't tested it so I can't say for sure. If in doubt, please backup your files 
first!

The patch will over-write:
* The entire DATA\SOUNDS folder
* The entire DATA\SCRIPTS folder
* Two files (CREDITS0.TGA and CREDITS1.TGA) in the DATA\TEXTURES folder

No EXEs or other files are touched.


4. Installation
---------------
- You should have downloaded seven RAR files. Open the first file (op.m.part01.rar) using WinRAR.
- Click on the 'Extract To' button.
- For the destination folder, select the location you installed Operation Matriarchy in (e.g. 
  C:\GAMES\OPERATION MATRIARCHY or C:\PROGRAM FILES\BUKA\OPERATION MATRIARCHY).
- Hit 'OK.'
- When you're asked to confirm whether you want to overwrite any files, select 'Yes to all.'
- That's it! Now you can load the game and play :)


5. Known Issues
---------------
- Existing savegames should work just fine with the patch. However, you probably won't hear any music 
  until you complete the level you're currently on. Music will kick in at the start of the next level. 
- The 'Music Volume' slider in the options menu will NOT affect in-game music. There was no support 
  for in-game music so we had to implement it as part of the general sound system. Therefore, the 
  'Sound Volume' slider will control both sound effects and music.
- Some sounds are still missing: Yep, some of the Velians are still using silent weapon technology.
  There was really no way around this and believe me, we tried. But the good news is that MOST sounds
  are there and in the noisy heat of battle, you won't even notice.
- Menu music is used on the first level! - Don't worry. All the other music in the game is new. We
  simply used the menu theme for the first level because it's great :D
- Objectives don't stay onscreen long enough: No problem. Just hold down the 'objectives' key (TAB,
  by default) to see the current message. We've tried to make the story and characters more 
  interesting in this version of the game, so pay attention to the messages you get!
